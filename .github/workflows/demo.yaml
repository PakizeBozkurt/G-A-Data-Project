#The code starts by specifying the name of the deployment as "Deploy website".

#The on section defines the triggers for this deployment. 
#In this case, it is triggered on a push event to the "main" branch of the repository.

#The code defines a job called "test" which represents a set of tasks to be executed. 
#This job runs on an "ubuntu-latest" machine.

#The steps section contains a list of tasks to be executed within the "test" job.

#The first step is to "Get code" using the actions/checkout@v3 action, which retrieves the source code from the repository.
