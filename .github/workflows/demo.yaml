#The code starts by specifying the name of the deployment as "Deploy website".

#The on section defines the triggers for this deployment. 
#In this case, it is triggered on a push event to the "main" branch of the repository.

#The code defines a job called "test" which represents a set of tasks to be executed. 
#This job runs on an "ubuntu-latest" machine.

#The steps section contains a list of tasks to be executed within the "test" job.

#The first step is to "Get code" using the actions/checkout@v3 action, which retrieves the source code from the repository.

#The second step is to "Cache dependencies" using the actions/cache@v3 action. 
#This step caches the dependencies of the project, specifically the NPM packages, to speed up future builds.

#The third step is to "Install dependencies" using the npm ci command, 
#which installs the project dependencies based on the package.json file.

#The fourth step is to "Lint code" using the npm run lint command, 
#which performs static code analysis to identify and report coding errors or style violations.

#The fifth step is to "Test code" using the npm run test command, which executes the tests for the project.

#The "build" job is defined next. 
#It specifies that it depends on the successful completion of the "test" job (defined by needs: test).
